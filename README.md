# See-Speak-using-Raspberry-pi
I was the leader in the group project that involves using Raspberry pi 3 module B with a Raspberry pi camera module V3 and a set of 2 speakers to
• Capture a picture
• Analyzing and identifying texts in the picture 
• Converting it into a text file
• Read the text file out loud
Aside from leading the group members, my main role was programming and creating the code structure of the project using Python programming language.
